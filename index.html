            <h2>With thousands of people currently incarcerated in New York City, data shows Black people are being disproportionately locked up by police.</h2>

<center><div class="copy"> <p class="intro">Black people continue to be disproportionately incarcerated in New York City, despite making up less than 25 per cent of the overall population.</p>

<p>For public defender Olayemi Olurin, the vast majority of clients she represents in court are facing “crimes of poverty.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, Olurin believes funds should be reallocated from incarceration and dedicated to providing accessible and affordable housing for New Yorkers.</p>

<p>“Rehabilitation always feels like I'm putting the onus on a person for how they responded to a system that put them in that position,” Olurin said. “Rehabilitation to me is a word that needs to be used for the state and not the people.”</p>

<p>Olurin also voiced concern about Adams’ recent comments backtracking on his promise to follow through with the closure of Rikers Island by 2027. Before becoming mayor, Adams spent more than 20 years working in policing, eventually retiring as a captain in 2006.</p>

<p>By expanding solitary confinement, rallying against bail reform and stacking the courts with conservative judges, Olurin calls Adams’ reticence to close Rikers “a self-fulfilling prophecy he’s intentionally bringing about.”</p>

<p>“He's saying, ‘We can't close Rikers because there's so many people that are in Rikers, but he is the one making sure that there are too many people in Rikers,” Olurin said. “We’re watching the intentional madness of a cop.”</p>

<p>Data shows more than 80 per cent of Americans charged with a felony crime are represented by public defenders, a statistic Olurin says shows the vast majority of those in the criminal justice system are underneath the poverty line.</p>

<p>“If you have people who are quite literally impoverished, they are destitute, and they are doing things as a result of that,” she said.

<p>Bianca Tylek is the founder executive director of Worth Rises, a Brooklyn-based organization fighting to dismantle the prison system and those who are exploited by it.</p>

<p>She believes the root causes of incarceration can be addressed by both better and fewer resources that, like the health-care system, focus on preventative measures to help individuals avoid the criminal justice system altogether.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to be a political economist to come to the very obvious conclusion that paying $1,5000 a person to incarcerate someone is probably not the most economical solution to public safety,” Tylek said.</p>
